              There are two kinds of lobsters: clawed lobsters and spiny
              lobsters (or rock lobsters). Clawed lobsters are generally found
              in cold marine waters and include the American lobster, a popular
              variety served at seafood restaurants, especially in New England.

              Spiny lobsters do not have claws. They do, however, have long,
              strong antennae. These lobsters are generally found in warm water
              environments such as the Caribbean and the Mediterranean. As a
              seafood dish, they most often show up on the menu as lobster tail.
